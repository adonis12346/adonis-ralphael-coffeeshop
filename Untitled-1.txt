Encryption: To protect messages from unauthorized access, you can use end-to-end encryption. This means encrypting the messages on the sender's device and decrypting them on the recipient's device. One popular encryption protocol is the Signal Protocol, which provides secure communication with features like forward secrecy and deniability.

Authentication: To ensure that users are who they claim to be, you can implement user authentication using a combination of secure login mechanisms such as username/password, two-factor authentication, or biometric authentication. Additionally, you can use digital certificates or public key infrastructure (PKI) to verify the identity of users and protect against impersonation attacks.

Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: To mitigate DoS attacks, you can employ various strategies:

1. Rate limiting: Implement mechanisms to limit the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a specific time frame.
2. Traffic filtering: Use firewalls or intrusion detection systems to filter out malicious traffic.
